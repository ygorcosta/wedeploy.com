#### Add API Method

Now we want to add a script that will send an email. To do this, go to `tutorial-email-web/ui/main.js` and paste this code:

```javascript
WeDeploy
	.email('msgs-<projectID>.wedeploy.io')
	.auth('yourMasterToken')
	.from(form.from.value)
	.to(form.to.value)
	.subject(form.subject.value)
	.message(form.message.value)
	.send()
	.then(function(response) {
		if (response.succeeded()) {
			form.reset();
			alert('Email sent! Wait a little bit until it arrives :)');
			console.info('Email ID:', response);
		}
		else {
			alert('Email was not sent');
		}
	})
	.catch(function(error) {
		alert('Email error:' error);
	});
```

**Note:** make sure to replace `<projectID>` with the id of your project.

#### Add master token

In order for your email request to be authorized, you must add your project's unique Master Token.

1. Go to the <a href="https://console.wedeploy.com" target="_blank">WeDeploy Console</a>
2. Click on your project
3. Go to the _Settings_ section
4. Copy your Master Token
5. Paste it into the `.auth('yourMasterToken')` element in the code above on `main.js`

###### <span class="icon-16-star"></span> Pro Tip

As you can see, the input values from the form are being used as email parameters (from, to, subject, etc). We have a bunch of parameters so you can fully configure your email posts.
