#### It Works

Great work, your project is ready to be used!

Go to `app-<projectID>.wedeploy.io` in your browser.

Awesome! You just deployed a Liferay DXP instance within a few minutes! We can't wait to see what else you create with WeDeploy!

###### <span class="icon-16-star"></span> Pro Tip

Wanting to make a pretty url for your service without purchasing a custom domain? Perfect, you can go to the _Custom Domain_ section of your service on the Dashboard and add a custom domain that ends with `wedeploy.io` (e.g. `yourapp.wedeploy.io`).
