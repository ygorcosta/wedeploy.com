#### Deploy Project

Now the moment you have been waiting for!

Go to `tutorial-data-web` in your terminal and deploy your project [using the CLI](/docs/intro/using-the-command-line/).

```xml
we deploy -p projectID
```

**Note:** make sure to replace `projectID` with the ID that you'd like for your project.
