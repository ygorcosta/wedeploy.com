##### Create files

Now that we have the sample files, we can setup our email container. 

First go to `tutorial-email-js` and create a directory named `email`. 

Within that directory, create a new file named `container.json`. This file will designate the id and type of service you are using. Inside of that file, add: 

```application/json
{
	"id": "email",
	"type": "wedeploy/email"
}
```

* `id` is the custom name designated for this service. In future projects, feel free to change this value to whatever best describes your service. 
* `type` tells WeDeploy what service to use.
