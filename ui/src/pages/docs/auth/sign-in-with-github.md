## Sign-in with gitHub

To sign in by redirecting to the sign-in page, call `signInWithRedirect`:


```javascript
var auth = WeDeploy.auth('http://<serviceID>.<projectID>.wedeploy.io');

var provider = new auth.provider.Github();
provider.setProviderScope("user:email");

auth.signInWithRedirect(provider);

auth.onSignIn(function(user) {
	// Fires when user is signed in after redirect.
});
```
```swift
let auth = WeDeploy.auth("<auth-url>");
let provider = AuthProvider(provider: .github, redirectUri: "my-app://")
provider.providerScope = "user:email"

auth.signInWithRedirect(provider: provider) { (user, error) in
	// Fires when user is signed in after redirect.
}

//Add WeDeploy.auth("<auth-url>").handle(url: url) in AppDelegate's open url method	
```

## Setup app client id and secret

Create a client id and client secret by [registering your application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) on GitHub. 

<aside>

Please be sure to add the callback url `http://<auth-container-id>.<project-id>.wedeploy.io/oauth/token` in your application.
For local development, use `wedeploy.me` instead. To use with custom domains you can change the sufix `<project-id>.wedeploy.io` for your domain.

</aside>

After retrieving the client id and client secret you can configure them as environment variables of the authentication `container.json`.

```application/json
{
	"id": "auth",
	"name": "Auth",
	"type": "wedeploy/auth",
	"env": {
		"WEDEPLOY_AUTH_GITHUB": "true",
		"WEDEPLOY_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID": "<your-github-client-id>",
		"WEDEPLOY_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET": "<your-github-client-secret>"
	}
}
```

Or you can add those environment variables using the dashboard.
