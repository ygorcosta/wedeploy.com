## Javascript API Installation

In order to send/receive requests to/from WeDeploy, we need to include the JavaScript API Client. This library provides a secure and reliable communication channel with WeDeploy. We can do that by simply adding a script tag in a HTML file:

```xml
<script src="http://cdn.wedeploy.com/api/latest/wedeploy.js"></script>
```

## Swift API Installation

If you want to send/receive requests to/from WeDeploy from an iOS App, we also have a solution for that, the Swift API Client. In order to start using it you have to do:

#### Cocoapods

Add this to your Podfile

```swift
pod 'WeDeploy'
```

#### Carthage

Add this to your Cartfile

```swift
github 'wedeploy/api-swift'
```

#### API nuances

By default, all swift api requests returns a promise, for example:

```swift
WeDeploy
	.data("http://<serviceID>.<projectID>.wedeploy.io");
	.get(resourcePath: "movies")
	.then { movie in 
		print(movie)
	}
```

But you will be able to return a callback or even an observable! You will have this two methods available:

```swift
// The method toCallback converts a promise into a callback
WeDeploy
	.data("http://<serviceID>.<projectID>.wedeploy.io");
	.get(resourcePath: "movies")
	toCallback { movies, error in
		// here you can check the error or the response
	}

// The method toObservable converts a promise into an observable
WeDeploy
	.data("http://<serviceID>.<projectID>.wedeploy.io");
	.get(resourcePath: "movies")
	.toObservable()
	.subscribe(
		onNext: { movies in
			// here you receive the movies
		},
		onError: { error in
			// oops something went wrong
		}
	)
```
