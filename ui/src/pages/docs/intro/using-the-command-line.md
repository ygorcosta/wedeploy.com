## Dependencies

The following external software dependencies are necessary to correctly run some commands:

a) [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (download for [Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux), [macOS](https://git-scm.com/download/mac), [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win))

b) [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (download for [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/), [macOS](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg), [Windows](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/InstallDocker.msi))

Docker version 1.12.0 or later is required. If you use macOS, install the Docker for Mac. If you use Windows, please install Docker for Windows. Docker Toolbox, still available for earlier Mac and Windows systems is not supported.

## Installing

If you use a Unix-like system such as macOS or Linux open your Terminal and run:

```xml
curl https://cdn.wedeploy.com/cli/latest/wedeploy.sh -sL | bash
```

If you use Windows, you probably want the [Windows amd64 installer](https://bin.equinox.io/c/8WGbGy94JXa/cli-stable-windows-amd64.msi). For other systems, check a list of [all builds available](https://dl.equinox.io/wedeploy/cli/stable).

**Check your docker configuration:** docker comes with a 2.0GB maximum memory limit by default on macOS and Windows. You should increase this limit to at least 4.0GB.

## Creating projects locally

You are able to organize your services by project. Inside each project you can create services (called containers here), like static hosting, data API, Auth service, etc.

Use `we create` to create projects and containers. You can create a project anywhere on your machine. Containers might be created one directory above a project for your convenience.

```xml
Usage:
	we create --project <projectID> --container <serviceID>
```

## Running projects locally

For this demo we are going to use the hosting boilerplate.

<ol>

<li>Start local infrastructure:</li>

```xml
we run
```

<li>Clone this repository:</li>

```xml
git clone https://github.com/wedeploy/boilerplate-hosting.git
cd boilerplate-hosting
```

<li>Link this container to a new project named demo:</li>

```xml
we link --project demo
```

<li>Now your container should be accessible from <a href="http://hosting.demo.wedeploy.me">hosting.demo.wedeploy.me</a></li>

</ol>

*The first time you run the project it might take a few minutes while the hosting image is being downloaded in the background.*

## Remotes and friendly host style
Many commands requires `--project`, `--container`, or `--remote` flags. You can use the following patterns for passing these values:

```xml
we <command> --project <projectID> --container <serviceID>
```

and the friendly host style:

```xml
we <command> <serviceID>-<projectID>.<remote address>
```

or even

```xml
we <command> <serviceID>-<projectID> --remote <remote>
```

For the local cloud, just don't add a `--remote` or `<remote address>` value like in:

```xml
we log public.chat
```

or to list all logs by containers on the project "chat":

```xml
we log chat
```

Remotes can be managed in a similar fashion as git's remote command:

```xml
$ we remote -v
wedeploy       	wedeploy.io
```

If you know how to use `git remote` you already know how to use `we remote`.

For your convenience we include the wedeploy cloud remote by default once you log in on the CLI app with `we login` (requested when necessary).

All commands that support `--project`, `--container`, and / or `--remote` support this host style as well.

## Fetching project and container logs

You can fetch projects and container logs with

```xml
we log --project <projectID> --container <serviceID>
```

or with a friendly host style like

```xml
we log <serviceID>-<projectID>.wedeploy.me
```

##### Examples:

See the logs for the last 20min for the data container on the wechat project:

```xml
we log --project wechat --container data --since 20min
```

Watch for logs on the hosting container on the demo project:
```xml
we log hosting.demo.wedeploy.me --watch
```

## Listing projects and containers

Watch the listing of all projects running locally:
```xml
we list --watch
```

List all your projects running on the WeDeploy cloud:
```xml
we list wedeploy.io
```

or
```xml
we list --remote wedeploy
```
