## Configuring

<aside>

All WeDeploy projects use a consistant file structure and configuration files to deploy apps with Git or GitHub. Learn more on our <strong><a href="/docs/intro/how-it-works.html">How It Works Page</a></strong>.

</aside>

Below is a few examples of a `container.json` for the Java container.

```gradle
{
	"id": "java",
	"type": "wedeploy/java:latest",
	"hooks": {
  	"build": "gradle -Dorg.gradle.native=false clean build -x test"
  }
}
```
```maven
{
	"id": "java",
	"type": "wedeploy/java:latest",
	"hooks": {
  	"build": "mvn package"
  }
}
```
```ant
{
	"id": "java",
	"type": "wedeploy/java:latest",
	"hooks": {
  	"build": "ant build"
  }
}
```

The `id` for your services are uniquely determined by you.
