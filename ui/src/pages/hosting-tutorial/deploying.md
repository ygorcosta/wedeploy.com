##### Deploying your project

Now its time to push your local boilerplate to your WeDeploy project.

First, add a git remote. Within `boilerplate-hosting` on your command line, run: 
```
git remote add wedeploy http://git.wedeploy.com/<your-project-name>.git
```

Then make a first commit
* `git add .`
* `git commit -m "Awesome change"`
* `git push wedeploy master`

Go to the WeDeploy dashboard and select your project. On the right you should see the build log of your recent commit. 

Once you see "Deploy was successful" go to `<service-name>.<project-name>.wedeploy.io`.

Voilà! Your page is live!
