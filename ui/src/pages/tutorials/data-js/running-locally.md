##### Running locally

WeDeploy provides a dev environment for you to run and test your app before pushing it to production. Lets get that running for this project!

In your terminal, run `we run`. Once it is done, open a new tab and run `we link --project tutorial-data-js`

You can now go to `http://tutorial-data-js.wedeploy.me` in your browser and see the local deployment of your project. Any changes you make to your project folder now will automatically be deployed to this local server.
