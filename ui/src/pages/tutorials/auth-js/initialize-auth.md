##### Initializing the Auth Service

Now that we have the sample files clones and a local environemnt running, we can initialize our Authentication. 

First go to `tutorial-auth-js` and create a file named `main.js`. This file will contain our Authentication scripts. Inside of `main.js`, add: 

```javascript
WeDeploy.auth('auth.tutorial-auth-js.wedeploy.io')
```
