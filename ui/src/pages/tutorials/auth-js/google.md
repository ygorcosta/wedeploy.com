##### Adding Google

You added GitHub authentication but what if you want to give your users the option of logging in with their Google credentials? Underneath the GitHub script in `main.js`, paste: 

```javascript
function signInWithGoogle() {
	var googleProvider = new auth.provider.Google();
	googleProvider.setProviderScope('email');
	auth.signInWithRedirect(googleProvider);
}
```

Just like GitHub, `signInWithRedirect` allows the user to be redirected to Google in order to verify their login information and then redirected back to your app's authentication.
