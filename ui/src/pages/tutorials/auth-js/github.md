##### Adding GitHub

You added email and password authentication but what if you want to let give your users the option of loggin in with their GitHub credentials? Underneath the email and password script in `main.js`, paste: 

```javascript
function signInWithGithub() {
	var githubProvider = new auth.provider.Github();
	githubProvider.setProviderScope('user:email');
	auth.signInWithRedirect(githubProvider);
}
```

`signInWithRedirect` allows the user to be redirected to GitHub in order to verify their login information and then redirected back to your app's authentication.
