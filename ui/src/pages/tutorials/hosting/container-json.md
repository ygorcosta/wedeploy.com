##### Adding the container.json

Every WeDeploy container needs a container.json file to specify the id and type of service you are using. Let's create one for hosting.

1. Go to the `tutorial-hosting` directory
2. Create a file called `container.json`
3. Open it in your text editor
4. Paste the follow code

```application/json
{
	"id": "hosting",
	"type": "wedeploy/hosting"
}
```
* `id` is the custom name designated for this service. If you named your service something other than "hosting", change the value of the `id` to the name of the hosting service you created on the dashboard.
* `type` tells WeDeploy what service to use.
