#### Add Config Files

Every service folder must have a `container.json` file that configures the service. Let's add one to our Auth Service in the repo we just cloned.

##### Auth

1. Open the `tutorial-auth-ios` folder in a code editor.
2. Create a new file named `container.json` inside the `auth` folder.
3. In that file, paste this code:

```application/json
{
	"id": "auth",
	"type": "wedeploy/auth:latest",
	"env": {
		"WEDEPLOY_AUTH_SECURE_FIELDS": "password",
		"WEDEPLOY_AUTH_PASSWORD": "true"
	}
}
```

###### <span class="icon-16-star"></span> Pro Tip

One of the awesome things you can do in your `container.json` file is add environment variables. There are many ways to use these; one example is to provide Google sign-in for your users.

```application/json
{
	"id": "auth",
	"type": "wedeploy/auth:latest",
	"env": {
		"WEDEPLOY_AUTH_SECURE_FIELDS": "password",
		"WEDEPLOY_AUTH_PASSWORD": "true",
		"WEDEPLOY_AUTH_GOOGLE": "true",
		"WEDEPLOY_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID": "<your-google-app-id>",
		"WEDEPLOY_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET": "<your-google-app-secret>"
	}
}
```
