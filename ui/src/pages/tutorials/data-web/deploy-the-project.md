#### Deploy the Project

Now the moment you have been waiting for - deployment!

###### Add a Git remote

Open up your terminal and go to the `tutorial-data-web` folder. Then, add a git remote by running:

```xml
git remote add wedeploy http://git.wedeploy.com/<your-project-id>.git
```

###### Push first commit

The remote is now set up and you are ready to make your first commit!

1. `git add .`
2. `git commit -m "Awesome commit"`
3. `git push wedeploy master`

If it is your first time pushing to WeDeploy's git, you will need to enter the email and password for your WeDeploy account.

###### See it live

Once you have pushed, WeDeploy will immediately start deploying your project.

Give it a few moments and then go to `hosting.<your-project-id>.wedeploy.io` to see what you deployed! Pretty cool, right?
