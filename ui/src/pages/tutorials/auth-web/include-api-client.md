#### Include API Client

Before we can make any requests to create or sign-in any users, we must connect the WeDeploy API Client.

To do this, go to `tutorial-auth-web/hosting/` and include this script link at the bottom of the `<body>` element of these files:

<ul class="checklist">
	<li><code>index.html</code></li>
	<li><code>signup.html</code></li>
	<li><code>welcome.html</code></li>
</ul>

```xml
<script src="https://cdn.wedeploy.com/api/latest/wedeploy.js"></script>
```
