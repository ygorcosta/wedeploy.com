#### It Works

Great work, your app is now live! Now let's start playing with user sign-in.

1. Go to `hosting.<your-project-id>.wedeploy.io` in your browser.
2. Click "Create an account" and fill in the form.
3. You are logged in! Now try signing out and signing back in.

Awesome! You just deployed an app and started authenticating users within a few minutes! We can't wait to see what else you create with WeDeploy!

###### <span class="icon-16-star"></span> Pro Tip

Do you have a primary UI (in this case, your Hosting Service) that you would like to be served by your project's main URL (`<your-project-id>.wedeploy.io`)? Perfect, that is extremely easy to do. Go to the settings tab of your project's console and select _hosting_ as your _Home Service_.
