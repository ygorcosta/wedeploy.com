#### It works

Great work, your app is now live! 🚀 Now let's start playing with user sing-in.

1. Go to `hosting.<your-project-id>.wedeploy.io` in your browser.
2. Click "Create an account" and fill in the form.
3. You are logged in! Now try signing out and signing back in.

Awesome! You just deployed an app and started authenticating users within a few minutes! We can't wait to see what else you create with WeDeploy!

Do you have a primary UI service that you would like to be served by your project's main URL (`<your-project-id>.wedeploy.io`)? Perfect, that is extremely easy to do by going to the settings tab of your project's dashboard and selecting a _Home Service_.
