#### Clone Sample Repo

First, you'll clone a sample repo that contains the necessary files and directories for deploying a site.

To do this, run the command below in your terminal:

```xml
git clone https://github.com/wedeploy/tutorial-java.git
```

In this example, we'll use [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) as our web framework. Don't worry if you've never used this before, there's no need to learn or download anything.

###### <span class="icon-16-star"></span> Pro Tip

Every WeDeploy project follows a similar file structure by using JSON files to manage your project and service-level configurations.

```xml
your-project
├── email
│   └── container.json
├── java
│   ├── container.json
│   └── pom.xml
└── project.json
```
