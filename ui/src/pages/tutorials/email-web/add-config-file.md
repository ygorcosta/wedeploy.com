#### Add Config File

Every service folder must have a `container.json` file that configures the service. Let's add one to our Email Service in the repo we just cloned.

1. Open the `tutorial-email-web` folder in a code editor.
2. Create a new file inside of the `email` folder and name it `container.json`.
3. Inside of that file, paste this code.

```application/json
{
	"id": "email",
	"type": "wedeploy/email"
}
```

Another thing you can do in your `container.json` file is add environment variables. There are many ways to use these, one example is to change to a unique email provider.

```application/json
{
	"id": "email",
	"type": "wedeploy/email:latest",
	"env" {
		"EMAIL_HOST": "host294.mailrave.com"
	}
}
```
