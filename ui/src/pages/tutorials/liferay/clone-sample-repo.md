#### Clone Sample Repo

First, you'll clone a sample repo that contains the necessary files and directories for deploying a site with Liferay.

To do this, run the command below in your terminal:

```xml
git clone https://github.com/wedeploy/tutorial-liferay.git
```

###### <span class="icon-16-star"></span> Pro Tip

Every WeDeploy project follows a similar file structure by using JSON files to manage your project and service-level configurations.

```xml
your-project
├── email
│   └── container.json
├── Liferay
│   └── container.json
└── project.json
```
