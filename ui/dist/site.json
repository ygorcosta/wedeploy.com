Environments have been around for a while, mainly hiding in the deep code forests, so we wanted to highlight them and share that we wrote some fresh documentation so you can start using them right away! Here are a couple easy ways they can improve your app! ​ 🚀 Change Hosting serve directory By default, WeDeploy Hosting looks to your service's root directory to know what files to serve, but what if you are using a Gulp or Grunt build task to compile your files? No problem, just add the WEDEPLOYWEBPATH key and use the build path as your value. See the full list at our Hosting Environment Variable Docs. 🔐 Integrate OAuth into your app Want your users to log in with Facebook, Google, or Github accounts? Perfect, because that is super easy to do with WeDeploy Auth. Start by just adding a few environment variables for each provider. See the full list at our Auth Environment Variable Docs. 📧 Change Email provider WeDeploy Email supplies you with an email service straight out of the box, but what if you want to use your own SMTP server? With Environment Variables, you can change the email host, username, port, and much more. See the full list at our Email Environment Variable Docs. That's it! If you have any question, just shoot us an email or join the conversation on Slack.

Which topics are covered? Hosting: Deploy static files like HTML, CSS, and JS. Data: Deploy a to-do list app using our Data Service and JS. Auth: Deploy an authentication app using our Auth Service and JS. Email: Deploy an email-sending app using our Email Service and JS. Java: Deploy an app using Java and Spring Boot. Ruby: Deploy an app using Ruby and Sinatra. Node.js: Deploy an app using Node.js and Express. Liferay: Deploy a Liferay Portal instance. Why tutorials? Everyone learns differently. Some simply want to grab snippets of code and implement them in their projects. Others want to see a walkthrough of how to use the code in a real-life situation. There is nothing like seeing the code in action, and that is exactly what tutorials provide! We felt like the first group was being well taken care of by our extensive documentation, but there was nothing for the second group. After brainstorming different ways to provide this kind of step-by-step flow for those users, we landed on the concept of a tutorial. What were our goals? We had three goals for our tutorials: Simple UX: This started with the design and bled all the way through to the words and phrasings we used. It had to be something that reflected one of the most important parts of the WeDeploy product itself: ease of use. Consistent Flow: Most users come with a goal in mind of what they want to implement and what stack they want to implement it with. But what about after they build that first app? We wanted to create a consistent experience and content flow across all the tutorials so that users could easily learn about other services that were not already familiar to them. Educational Content: The end goal of each tutorial is deploying and interacting with a fully functional app, but we didn't want users to just get to the end, we wanted them to learn something. We spent hours, even days, coming up with the balance between the difficulty and educational takeaway of the tutorial, and we are very excited with the results. What's in it for you? Like we said above, each tutorial takes you all the way from clone to deploy in a matter of minutes. This not only gives you a inside look into specific details of the service you are interested in, but it also teaches you about other things like source code file structure, API methods, configuration files, deployment flow using git, and so much more. --- So what are you waiting for?

From watching movies on your Apple TV, Receiving notifications on your smart watch, or reading books on your Kindle, we rarely go anywhere without our devices. It doesn't seem to be slowing down either; more and more devices are being built and more and more services are being created for them. Mobile and web development just isn't enough, we are entering an age of multi-device development. That's why WeDeploy was born with more than web development in mind. We understood that as more and more devices consumed API's, this would be the future of development. We didn't want to just use raw HTTP requests, so we built API Clients that could be called easily and safely. You already know about our JavaScript client, but starting today, there are two new kids on the block. Introducing the new WeDeploy iOS (Swift) and Android (Java) SDKs. With them, you will be able to build apps for the following platforms: Apple: iOS (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch), watchOS (AppleWatch), tvOS (AppleTV), macOS (CarPlay and Desktop apps). Google: Android phones and tablets, Android Wear, Android TV, Android Auto and any platform that supports Java! What can I do on those mobile platforms? Mainly, the clients provides you access to: Data service: Search inside your schema-less database or communicate in realtime with other apps, not matter the platform, using WebSockets under the hood. ↳ See iOS (Swift) and Android (Java) tutorials. Auth service: Create or authenticate users, reset passwords or sign-in using Google, Facebook or Github's OAuth2. ↳ See iOS (Swift) and Android (Java) tutorials. Email service: Send emails directly from your app and check their delivery status. ↳ See iOS (Swift) and Android (Java) tutorials. Raw HTTP Requests: and if you would like to build your own HTTP requests, you can using our fluent API. How do I start Just use the regular package managers for each platform. target 'MyApp' do use_frameworks! ... rest of your dependencies ... pod 'WeDeploy' end dependencies { ... rest of your dependencies ... compile 'com.wedeploy:com.wedeploy.android:beta-20170505' } It's that easy!

This is a simple guide about how to migrate your projects and data to our new infrastructure without skipping a beat.","date":"July 31, 2017","author":"Jonni Lundy","image":"/images/blog/post-13--0.png","layout":"blog","content":" On July 31st, we announced our new Beta version of WeDeploy. With that release we introduced the new infrastructure on AWS that can be accessed by our Console. Along with that big infrastructure change, we also introduced other things like custom Docker images and HTTPS, which lead to a big question that you might be asking yourself: will the projects I built on Alpha work on Beta? The answer is 'yes', but there are a few easy changes that need to be made. Below is a guide on how to seamlessly do that! If you have any trouble, feel free to tap on the green button in the bottom corner to talk to a WeDeploy human, we'd love to help. --- Migrating Projects We have made some fundamental changes to the way you setup your project source code and simplified the way you deploy your apps. Walk through these easy steps and your project will be ready for deployment. Step One: Configuration Files Delete project.json. We no longer support these files. Rename all container.json files to wedeploy.json. In wedeploy.json, change type to image and add :beta tag. Here is an example of what the new wedeploy.json will look like. { \"id\": \"ui\", \"image\": \"wedeploy/hosting:beta\" } Attention We no longer support the Java, Node.js, and Ruby WeDeploy images. To deploy projects with those languages, you can simply remove the image variable completely from your wedeploy.json and we will automatically detect the type of build you need. Step Three: API Client Update your CDN API links to https (yes, just simply add the 's'). Each service now has its own domain instead of being a subdomain of your project. This means you must update your API endpoints (serviceID-projectID.wedeploy.io). Remove hardcoded protocals (http://) on API URL's. The Email API for JavaScript has changes. See the documentation. Update your Auth redirect URL's for your registered apps if you use OAuth providers like Google and Github. There is no way to migrate your previous users manually. To do so, reach out to us with the green circle button below and we can help you port your userbase. --- Migrating Data Collections Once you have your project redeployed on the Console, you might want to migrate your old data to your new site. Follow these instructions to do that. Step One: Save Data Go to the Dashboard of the project you are fetching the collection from and select the Data service. Click the link of your data service at the top and amend the collection you are wanting to migrate to the url like this: data-demo.wedeploy.io/todos. If you have authentication parameters on your collection, you will need to update your api.json and deploy again. Now that you can see a your collection, press cmd + s to save as a JSON file onto your machine. Step Two: Post Data Now open up your terminal and paste the script below. Make sure to replace your new project’s info in place of serviceID, projectID, [desired] collectionID, and masterToken. curl --request POST \\ --url https://serviceID-projectID.wedeploy.sh/collectionID \\ --header 'authorization: bearer masterToken' \\ --header 'content-type: application/json' \\ --data 'databaseDocuments' Open the JSON file you saved, select all the contents, copy to your clipboard, and paste into the script where you see databaseDocuments (inside the apostrophes). Now you can run the command. If it worked, you should see a response similar to this: {\"hasFailures\":false,\"results\":[{\"created\":true,\"document\":{\"id\":\"234841345046097992\"},\"successful\":true},{\"created\":true,\"document\":{\"id\":\"234841345053839632\"},\"successful\":true}]}% Now you can go to that data service on the Console and click on the Database section. You should now be able to see the documents you saved.

To build this multi-service project, I will use the WeDeploy Java, Hosting, and Data services.","date":"Mar 17, 2017","author":"Manuel de la Peña","image":"/images/blog/post-6--0.png","layout":"blog","directory":"email-js","content":" {$page.description} I'm currently studying Research in Software Engineering and Computer Science for my master's degree and decided to build this platform to complete some requirements for a class about Ubiquitous Computing. In this class I've learned the basic concepts of IoT, starting with the initial intent to simulate the real world with smart devices. I believe the IoT train is passing and if we don't get on, we will miss out. That's why I decided to explore more. I realized that in the short period of time I had to accomplish this, I would need to learn how to use and configure a complete new tool like Kaa or Machina.io. But I just wanted a place to simulate an IoT platform super fast. Then a thought occured to me: Why not use WeDeploy to host my app? It already provides all the infrastructure I need. With WeDeploy, you manage git repositories and wrap them into services that can be deployed into the platform. It also offers a set of useful, already-configured services such as Data, Users and Auth, or even a E-mail. This allows any developer to streamline a project with minimal infrastructure configuration so they can just focus on coding the application they want to develop. The Stack So, here are the requirements for my project: An Android app that reads current speeds from a GPS and sends it each time the current location is changed. A server that reads the metrics sent by the Android app and stores them into persistent storage. A web interface to display the metrics stored in the database, reading from the server. The Android app is super easy to create, and has nothing to do with WeDeploy, just knowing the URL of the server where to send the metrics, so I won't go anymore into it. The two things that really matter are related to the API I wanted to create to accept the metrics sent by the devices and the visualisation of those metrics. Creating an API with WeDeploy In order to accept metrics from remote applications, I decided to create a REST API to handle the requests, and then it would store the metrics in a persistent storage. As WeDeploy offers a Data service, I decided that my REST API should communicate to that service to store the metrics. Then, I chose the framework to create the API. As I'm a Java developer, I chose Spring Boot to build it, which lets you create tiny applications and define REST resources in an extremely easy manner. So I created a project on the WeDeploy dashboard, and added a WeDeploy Java service named \"api\". I locally cloned the boilerplate-java project from Github, and started coding my REST API's there. Of course you can do this step with other technology you are more familiar with, and WeDeploy offers several server-side technologies to accomplish this including NodeJS and Ruby. Implementing a service In order to implement a WeDeploy service, it's mandatory to create a container.json file in the root of your folder, where you specify the type of the service you would like to use and some other behaviors. In the case of the WeDeploy Java service, you can set hooks to build the project once the service is created or updated. { \"id\": \"api\", \"type\": \"wedeploy/java:latest\", \"hooks\": { \"build\": \"gradle -Dorg.gradle.native=false clean build -x test\" } } In this case, because I used a Spring Boot project, the build system is based on Gradle, so I added the commands to build the project, excluding tests. Defining REST resources The following block of code demonstrates how to handle HTTP GET and POST requests in a Spring Boot controller. /** We'll handle all HTTP request to the path '/sensors' under application context path @author Manuel de la Peña */ @RestController @RequestMapping(\"/sensors\") public class SensorsRestController { /* Defines the resource for an specific sensor, identified by its sensorId, which is passed as input parameter to the method, using the annotation @PathVariable. It allows CORS requests from any domain. @return A collection of model domain objects */ @CrossOrigin(origins = \"*\") @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value = \"/{sensorId}\") public Collection getMetrics(@PathVariable String sensorId) {...} ... /* Define the resource for POST verb operations over this controller's path. The annotation @RequestBody indicates the type of the object that will be processed in the request. It allows CORS requests from any domain. */ @CrossOrigin(origins = \"*\") @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST) public ResponseEntity addMetric(@RequestBody Metric metric) {...} ... } Defining the save service Our API service needs to store the metrics in the WeDeploy Data service so I added a new service to the project on the WeDeploy dashboard, naming it data. Again, I cloned the boilerplate-data Github repository at the same level of my API service, and voilà! I have two services under my WeDeploy project. Here it is the container.json file for this new data service: { \"id\": \"data\", \"type\": \"wedeploy/data\" } But this data service must be configured to create a collection of elements. These are the pieces of data I wanted to gather about the sensor: Platform (app-android, app-ios, app-console), Unique identifier Coordinates (longitude, latitude) Value Name (temperature, speed, pressure, etc.) Unit of measure (celsius degrees, kilometers per hour, atmospheres, etc.) Timestamp (the moment of request) And I also had to define how this collection of data is accessed, and which HTTP verbs are allowed. You can configure this in WeDeploy data service with the api.json descriptor. This block shows the three REST resources that are accepted by my data service, and their specific paths: two for retrieving data, and one for storing data. [ { \"description\": \"Returns all sensors that sent metrics to the platform\", \"path\": \"/sensors/*\", \"method\": \"GET\", \"data\": true }, { \"description\": \"Returns one sensor identified by its unique sensorId\", \"path\": \"/sensors/:sensorId\", \"method\": \"GET\", \"data\": true }, { \"description\": \"Stores one sensor's metrics\", \"path\": \"/sensors\", \"method\": \"POST\", \"data\": true, \"parameters\": { \"applicationId\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"sensorId\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"latitude\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"longitude\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"metric\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"metricName\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"metricUnits\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"timestamp\": { \"type\": \"string\" } } } ] As you can see for the POST operation, I can validate the input parameters that are sent to the WeDeploy data service. Storing in the WeDeploy Data service Ok, once I had the data service configured, how could I communicate with it from the Java service, which represents the API? Well, the smart guys from WeDeploy team have provided a set of libraries to communicate with any WeDeploy service in an easy manner: you can consume WeDeploy's APIs with language-specific clients. In my case I will use a Java client, which I added to Gradle dependencies in the Java service. dependencies { compile(\"com.github.wedeploy.api-java:api:master-SNAPSHOT\") compile(\"com.github.wedeploy.api-java:api-client:master-SNAPSHOT\") ... } Added the dependencies, the communication with the WeDeploy Data service is performed in this block of code: public class DataRepository { /** Name of the data service to communicate with */ private static final String DATASERVICEPATH = \"data\"; /** Path of the Sensors collection */ private static final String SENSORSDATAPATH = \"/sensors\"; ... /** We filter the collection by sensorId column. Then, we parse the JSON object that represents the body of the response into a collection of model entities. */ public Collection findBySensorId(String sensorId) { WeDeploy weDeploy = new WeDeploy(DATASERVICEPATH + SENSORSDATAPATH); Response response = weDeploy.filter(\"sensorId\", sensorId).get(); JoddJsonParser parser = new JoddJsonParser(); return parser.parseAsList(response.body(), SensorRow.class); } /** We retrieve the whole collection, without pagination. Then, we parse the JSON object that represents the body of the response into a collection of model entities. */ public Collection findAllSensors() { WeDeploy weDeploy = new WeDeploy(DATASERVICEPATH + SENSORSDATAPATH); Response response = weDeploy.get(); JoddJsonParser parser = new JoddJsonParser(); return parser.parseAsList(response.body(), SensorRow.class); } ... } Here the WeDeploy object hides the magic of communicating with other WeDeploy services. As I'm in the same project, it's possible to resolve the service name directly with only its name, without using its whole URL, because WeDeploy directly resolves service names when services run within the same project. Displaying data At that point I had built two services: a Java REST API developed with Spring Boot, and a WeDeploy Data service for persistence. Then I wanted to display the metrics in a web interface. So, I created a third WeDeploy service, Hosting, which allows uploading static files, such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and gave it the name ui. Bellow is the container.json file that I made to impliment the Hosting Service. { \"id\": \"ui\", \"type\": \"wedeploy/hosting\" } I know that this is not related to WeDeploy, but I wanted to display the metrics in two different ways: a datagrid with all metrics, and a Google Maps interface with a pin where a metric was sent. With the following code, which is not the WeDeploy JavaScript client, I can retrieve the JSON objects returned from the Spring Boot API with browser's native fetch capability, process the response, and draw the results in the screen. function getSensors(mode) { return fetch(myUrl) .then(function(response) { if(response.ok) { return response.json(); } else if (response.status !== 200) { return []; } }) .then(function(sensors) { if (!sensors || sensors.length === 0) { noResults(); // shows a not found message return; } if (mode == 'grid') { plotSensors(sensors); // draws a grid } else { mapSensors(sensors); // draws a google map } return this; }); } Please remember I'm a backend developer interested in Systems, so shame on me for this JavaScript code! Hey, at least I put it in a separate JavaScript file. 😂 Thanks to the WeDeploy team, a JS client is also available. Super cool! You only need to add this script to your page and you're ready to go: Summary With WeDeploy I could accomplish the task of creating a very basic stack to handle requests. I wrote a a service representing an API for accepting requests, a service to store data, and a service representing a UI for the metrics. And all of that has been accomplish just using a couple lines of code + git skills, with no infrastructure knowledge needed!

But what were the rules? For this event, we simply asked each team to use WeDeploy in their projects. Other than that, they could build whatever they wanted. Let's do this! At 9am they all started to arrive and we gave everyone five minutes to write down project ideas. Then, they each presented their ideas to the whole group and mentioned specific resources or talent that they would need to accomplish it. The rest of the participants were free to join whatever project interested them. The ideas were ready, the teams were made, and the countdown was started. Nine hours later we got the results!

Then you focus only on one task during that time, and after the timer is done, you can tend to other things like meetings, emails, and coffee breaks. The problem is that sometimes you leave the signal up or maybe never put it there in the first place so the others at work don't know if they can interupt you or not. The good news is that this project fixes those problems with a Slack notification integration and a designated site to start and track the Salmorejos that are happening in your office. What they used: WeDeploy Hosting, WeDeploy Data Presenting the result of our #hackday.

We have good news for you, this team created a multi-device system for ordering pizza, going from a Apple TV app, to your cell phone, to the deliverer's iPad, and then of course, to your hungry stomache. What they used: WeDeploy Data Tinder for Startups This team had an exciting day. Although they did not have a finished prototype at the end of the day, they had the opportunity of diving deep into many technologies that none of them had tried before. When presenting, they talked about all the things they had learned and how even though the didn't finish anything, the lessons they learned on the journey were invaluable. Eyes to Run Technology is doing great things in the world of helping the disabled, and this project was no different. This team created an app that paired up blind runners with non-blind partners so that they are able to pound the pavement again. This team also won the grand prize for the hack day! What they used: WeDeploy Hosting, WeDeploy Data, WeDeploy Auth, WeDeploy Java The day was a huge success, and we were impressed and inspired by what each team produced! We're also so thankful for the hospitality of the Madrid office and the courageous developers in the hack day that pushed the limits and tried things they weren't sure they were capable off. In the train heading home after the @wedeploy hackday. So many positive energy from #liferayers creating amazing projects... or products? 😲&mdash; Manuel de la Peña (@mdelapenya) May 9, 2017 Till next time, Spain!

That's why we are excited to announce that React Native and React VR are joining the list too! If you are not aware of React Native, this is it in a nutshell - it allows you to build mobile applications using only JavaScript. Interestingly, you don't build a \"hybrid app\"; rather, you use the same UI building blocks as a regular iOS and Android application, and leverage the full power of the mobile platforms to create a real, first class mobile application. Also, React VR allows you to step into the the Virtual Reality and build VR websites and interactive 360 experiences with React. Using WeDeploy in React Native and React VR There is no difference between the usage of the JavaScript API for Web and React Native or React VR. The same API calls for Data, Auth, and Email are available when your app is running in React Native or React VR environment too. There are no API nuances - the same code you would write for a Web application, will run successfully on React Native and React VR too. Here is an example taken from the boilerplate application: WeDeploy .data('') .orderBy('id', 'desc') .limit(5) .get('tasks') .then((tasks) = { this.setState({ items: tasks }); }) .catch((error) = { console.error(error); }); The above code establishes a connection with the Data Service and retrieves the first five To-do tasks, then sets them to the state of the component to be rendered on the screen. Building an application To help you start building applications, we created an example To-Do List application. You may check the code here. The application is short but powerful enough to showcase a few fundamental things: Instantiating WeDeploy Working with the data service Working with Real-time events Sharing application code between iOS and Android. Here is what the To-Do List application looks like: Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video in WebM with VP8/VP9 or MP4 with H.264. We are excited to see what you start building with WeDeploy using React Native and React VR!

Where we've come 314 days ago, we launched the first app on WeDeploy. It was such an exhilarating time but we had our eyes set on the future. The thing is, WeDeploy didn't start as \"WeDeploy\". Almost two years ago, me and a few others spent our spare time working on this project called Launchpad. It was just a shadow of what WeDeploy is today, but it was a start. It was our start. After that first app was deployed, we got right back to work. Yes, we had achieved something, but it still had much room to grow. We needed to challenge our own mindset and imagination in order to create a platform that could change the way people develop software. We believe that this release puts us much closer to that goal. --- What changed? 1. Completely New Infrastructure One of the biggest changes was moving the WeDeploy infrastructure from our servers in the Liferay Headquarters to AWS. We knew that in order to continue to grow and expand globally, we had to start preparing now. This move has greatly impacted the stability of WeDeploy and even though we don't support multi-region deployments yet, we are excited that this change will make that possible in the near future. 2. Rewritten CLI, API, and Dashboard One of our goals the past nine months was not to just build on top of what we had, but to also rethink the way we built WeDeploy and be willing to rebuilt parts of it from the ground up if needed. We've spent weeks refactoring the CLI, API, and Dashboard (which is now known as Console) and I can confidently say, it was worth it! By refactoring, we gave ourselves the opportunity to not only clean up the code, but to also improve performance, usability, and overall design. 3. HTTPS Out of the Box Yes, now every project you deploy and every service you install will automatically be given an HTTPS certificate. This means your app will safely communicate with your users without you having to configure anything. We also make sure that those HTTPS certificates are valid by renewing them from time to time. That way you can always trust that your application will be secured. 4. Zero Downtime Deployments During alpha, whenever a new deployment was triggered, your app would go offline for couple seconds until the new version was 100% ready. We knew that was not ideal, so we sat down to build a much better experience that minimizes downtime and user interruption. Now, you don't have to worry about your app being taken down during deployment of the new code. Push updates and restart your services with zero downtime. 5. Custom Docker Services The container ecosystem has evolved a lot in the past years and Docker is probably mainly responsible for such success. Today we want to bring the benefits of this technology to you and facilitate the Docker-based development workflow. That's why we're introducing Dockerfile support. Back on alpha you were limited by the services we provided, now your imagination is the limit. This opens up the possibility to deploy pretty much anything and we look forward to see what you're going to create. Read more on the documentation or follow our step-by-step tutorial. 6. Volume Support With the addition of custom Docker services, new challenges arrive. For example, let's say you deploy an app with PHP and MySQL, then you start adding entries to your database. What happens when you restart that project without a proper setup? Well, you're going to lose all the data that was saved. In order to be able to persist and share data between services, we're introducing the concept of volumes. Quite simply, volumes are specially-designated directories that live outside of the file system where your code runs. This way, even if your application becomes unavailable due to a failure or other causes, your data still persists. Read more on the documentation. 7. Instant Deployment Before you had two ways of deploying code, you could either connect with GitHub or create a remote pointing to our Git server. We noticed that people loved the convenience of integrating with GitHub so we're keeping that, but when using our Git server the experience was not as fluid, specially the authentication step on every push. Because of that, we decided to rethink our CLI and introduce a new deploy command. Now you don't need to rely on Git for every deploy. All you need to do is type we login to authenticate only once and then run we deploy on your project folder. Read more on the documentation or install our command-line. 8. Automatic Code Detection If you used WeDeploy before, you probably remember this container.json file (now renamed to wedeploy.json). This file describes what is the name of the service, what are the environment variables needed, and most importantly what kind of project is this. WeDeploy needs to know if what you're deploying is a Ruby, Java, or Node.js project in order to download dependencies, compile, and build it in the right way. From now on, we'll try to determine what language your project uses, so you can deploy any folder containing static files, a Node.js app, or a Dockerfile and we will take it from there. That doesn't mean you don't need the wedeploy.json file anymore. That is still valid and important for us to know what directory to scan. Read more on the documentation. 9. Liferay DXP We're very excited about Liferay Digital Experience Platform. There are so many cool features and we want to give WeDeploy users the opportunity to try them out in seconds. Today, we're introducing Liferay DXP with a 15-day trial license. Besides that, we're adding support for hot deployment. That means you can now create a deploy folder, then add themes, portlets, OSGi modules, or a license using WAR, JAR, and XML files. What about Liferay Portal Community Edition? Since we have Docker support now, you can setup your own Dockerfile or grab an image from Docker Hub and deploy it here. Read more on the documentation or follow our step-by-step tutorial. 10. Global DNS We know how tedious could be the process of setting up your domains. That's why we're introducing a new reliable and scalable DNS solution. From now on, you can point your domains directly to our nameservers and we will automatically configure everything for you. We provide our DNS service across 7 different countries, including Australia, Germany, France, Netherlands, Singapore, United Kingdom, United States. Our goal is to ensure that you always have high availability and low latency resulting in a great experience for your users and your business. Read more on the documentation. --- What's next? Because of the new URL format and other changes described here, we weren't able to migrate your projects for you. That would be a risky thing to do and we don't your users to have any problems. All the projects you created on alpha still exist, however on August 31st they will be unavailable, along with the previous Dashboard. But don't worry, we already have a Migration Guide ready so you can get started right away. We're very excited to be able to share this new release with you!

You can start hosting your static files, building a database, or even sending an email within a couple of minutes!","headerTitle":"Deploy","layout":"guide","weight":1,"content":" {$page.title} {$page.description} Introduction There are basically two ways to deploy an app. You can use the command line for instant deployment or you can integrate with GitHub for continuous deployment. Both options give you a lot of power and flexibility, but there's another important concept that needs to be explained and that's our build step. When you send a bunch of files to WeDeploy we need to scan and detect what you would like to build. Maybe you want to run them with Java or maybe you just want to serve them as a static hosting. Automatic build detection The last thing any developer wants is to add a new tool that forces them to alter their workflow. This is why we've worked hard to build WeDeploy so it can fit right into your regular way of working and fill the gaps needed to take your development to the next level. WeDeploy tries to determine what language your project uses. It then takes the matching buildpack to install dependencies, compile the code and run the application. WeDeploy comes with a number of pre-configured buildpacks for languages like Java, Ruby, Node.js and so on. On deploy, the platform will detect the programming language and build & run the application. Manually set a build When you push your local repo to your WeDeploy project, we scan it for wedeploy.json files, which specify the ID of your services as well as which service containers you are deciding to use. When we find a wedeploy.json, we serve that whole directory as a part of the service you defined within. For example, let's say you have a folder named my-project that uses the Hosting, Data, and Email services. This is what your project's file structure could look like: my-project ├── data │ ├── api.json │ └── wedeploy.json ├── email │ └── wedeploy.json └── hosting ├── wedeploy.json ├── index.html └── main.css The wedeploy.json file is a JSON file defining the service attributes and configurations. The default path for a wedeploy.json is .//wedeploy.json. WeDeploy uses this json file to reference a service by ID in case it's already created. If a service with a matching ID does not exist, it creates a new service for you. Reference: | Field | Description | | ----- | ----------- | | id | Unique service ID. | | image | Service stack/image type. | | env | Environment variables to be exported in the service lifecycle. | Usage: { \"id\": \"conqueror\", \"image\": \"wedeploy/java\", \"description\": \"WeDeploy Service Example\", \"hooks\": { \"build\": \"./gradlew clean build installDist -x test\" }, \"env\": { \"WEDEPLOY_USER\": \"user\" } } Try it yourself We have created a whole array of tutorials to teach you how to start using WeDeploy. Click on one of the links below that interests you and begin your journey towards deployment! Hosting: Deploy static files like HTML, CSS, and JS. Data: Deploy a to-do list app using our Data Service and JS. Auth: Deploy an authentication app using our Auth Service and JS. Email: Deploy an email-sending app using our Email Service and JS.

Once that's finished, WeDeploy will start building and deploying your application. In the end, you'll be able to see it online in any browser. If you don't have a project ready to deploy, you can download this simple project and run the we deploy command inside that folder. Notice that this command will create a random name for your project. If you want to specify a new name or choose an existing project, you just need to run: we deploy -p myproject What's next?

Understanding configuration files By default WeDeploy Data service is going to use all the JSON files starting with api-* and also the file api.json. These files are used to help you manage features such as path validation, authentication, and params validation. The api JSON files are located at the same path of the ./wedeploy.json and are used following the ordering filesystem. JSON attributes After understanding how the api configuration files work, it's time to learn what are the supported attributes: | Field | Description | | - | - | | path | The path that represents the collection used to handle the request data. | | data | Tells the service if the request to a collection should be stored or not. | | description | Used to describe the behavior of an endpoint. | | auth | Used to define authentication rules for the endpoint. | | method | HTTP method allowed for the request. | | parameters | Parameters and validation rules for the collection. | path A path represents the resource used to store your project data. [ { \"path\": \"/movies/:movieId\" }, { \"path\": \"/fruits/*\" } ] data You can create endpoints just for validation, in this case, data is used to finish the request in case you just need a validation or want to store the request in the collection. [ { \"path\": \"/fruits/*\", \"data\": true } ] description Used to describe the behavior of an endpoint. [ { \"description\": \"Returns actors of a movie\", \"path\": \"/movies/:movieId/actors\", \"method\": \"GET\" } ] auth You can unauthorized applications and users to access any endpoint by using the auth field. The example below verify if the application is authenticated in order to perform the request: [ { \"path\": \"/movies/*\", \"auth\": { \"validator\": \"$auth != null\" } } ] method Specifies the HTTP method used for the request. In the example bellow, it allows a GET request and if you try to do a PUT or DELETE the route will not be recognized and will fail. [ { \"path\": \"/movies/:movieId\", \"data\": true, \"method\": \"GET\" } ] parameters You generally would use parameters to force validation in order to make sure that the params sent to a collection follow predefined rules. [ { \"description\": \"Creates a new movie\", \"path\": \"/movies\", \"method\": \"POST\", \"parameters\": { \"title\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"required\": true } }, \"data\": true } ] Allowing usage of all the collections In order to freely use any collection with any kind of operation, you just need to add the following content in your api.json. [ { \"path\": \"/*\", \"data\": true } ] The path /\\* tells the data service to allow any request to the base path of the data service. Validating resources The Validator script will be executed in an environment where several request and server data will be available. In this environment, there are several global variables available to you that can be used to validate the request parameter, body, or even to authorize the request. The validator can be used as an integration with the Auth service: { \"path\": \"/movies/*\", \"auth\": { \"validator\": \"$auth != null\" } } The global variables are: | Variable | Description | | - | - | | $auth | The authenticated user of this request. If the request was not authenticated, it will be null. | | $config | The raw JSON data stored in the service's config.json file. | | $session | All stored session data. If the request had no session cookie, it will be an empty map for the new session created for this request. | | $params | The request params as they were loaded from url query and request body. All query and form parameters will be strings here. | | $values | The parsed request params, as they are used for parameter validation. All query and form parameters will be parsed to JSON values. | | $body | The parsed request body, according to the request Content-Type. | | $data | The data view for this request, if a data path is mounted in the API path, and the request path represents a key to access any data resource (collection, document or inner field from a document). It will be null otherwise. | Some common validators are: Authenticated users only: $auth !== null Mixed with dynamic values: $auth.id === $params.id Validate new data value agains old one: $body.timestamp $data.timestamp Multiple contitional validation: $auth !== null && $auth.id === $params.id What's next?

Watching data changes We presented a lot of features for data filtering and search. You may be wondering where the real-time aspect is in all of this. Well, it's throughout the features we just presented to you. To access our data in real-time, all we need to do is change the WeDeploy API get method to use to the watch method: WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .watch('movies') .on('changes', function(data) { console.log(data); }) .on('fail', function(error) { console.log(error); }); // You have to hold a strong reference to the socket or it will be released socket = WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .watch(resourcePath: \"movies\") socket.on([.changes, .error]) { data in switch(data.type) { case .changes: print(\"changes \\(data.document)\") case .error: print(\"error \\(data.document)\") default: break } } WeDeploy .data('https://data-datademo.wedeploy.io') .watch(\"movies\") .on(\"changes\", data - System.out.println(data)) .on(\"fail\", error - System.out.println(error)); Now every time the storage detects changes that affect the query you're watching, you will receive a changes notification with the response body you'd receive if you had done an HTTP GET instead. Furthermore, every time this change leads to an HTTP error response, you'll receive the error object in a fail notification on the client. Watching with advanced filters To present data using advanced search is simple as performing normal queries. You just would need to keep using the watch method and apply any filter you desire. WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .where('category', 'cinema') .or('category', 'cartoon') .watch('movies') .on('changes', function(data) { console.log(data); }) .on('fail', function(error) { console.log(error); }); // You have to hold a strong reference to the socket or it will be released socket = WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .where(field: \"category\", op: \"=\", value: \"cinema\") .or(field: \"category\", op: \"=\", value: \"cartoon\") .watch(resourcePath: \"movies\") socket.on([.changes, .error]) { data in switch(data.type) { case .changes: print(\"changes \\(data.document)\") case .error: print(\"error \\(data.document)\") default: break } } WeDeploy .data('https://data-datademo.wedeploy.io') .where(equal(\"category\", \"cinema\").or(\"category\", \"cartoon\")) .watch(\"movies\") .on(\"changes\", data - System.out.println(data)) .on(\"fail\", error - System.out.println(error)); Getting the latest changes The data service uses a query limit 500 by default. In order to always get the latest new record, you would need to limit the query by 1 and order by id desc. WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .limit(1) .orderBy('id', 'desc') .watch('movies') .on('changes', function(data) { console.log(data); }) .on('fail', function(error) { console.log(error); }); // You have to hold a strong reference to the socket or it will be released socket = WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .limit(1) .orderBy(field: \"id\", order: .DESC) .watch(resourcePath: \"movies\") socket.on([.changes, .error]) { data in switch(data.type) { case .changes: print(\"changes \\(data.document)\") case .error: print(\"error \\(data.document)\") default: break } } WeDeploy .data('https://data-datademo.wedeploy.io') .limit(1) .orderBy(\"id\", SortOrder.DESCENDING) .watch(\"movies\") .on(\"changes\", data - System.out.println(data)) .on(\"fail\", error - System.out.println(error)); What's next?

We can select the order of the results by passing a sort parameter, using the following code: WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .orderBy('rating', 'desc') .get('movies') .then(function(movies) { console.log(movies); }); WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .orderBy(field: \"rating\", order: .DESC) .get(resourcePath: \"movies\") .then { movies in print(movies) } WeDeploy .data('https://data-datademo.wedeploy.io') .orderBy(\"rating\", SortOrder.DESCENDING) .get(\"movies\") .execute(); As expected, the result would be the following list: [ {\"id\":\"starwarsv\",\"title\":\"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back\",\"year\":1980,\"rating\":8.8}, {\"id\":\"starwarsiv\",\"title\":\"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\",\"year\":1977,\"rating\":8.7}, {\"id\":\"starwarsvi\",\"title\":\"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi\",\"year\":1983,\"rating\":8.4}, {\"id\":\"starwarsiii\",\"title\":\"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith\",\"year\":2005,\"rating\":7.7}, {\"id\":\"starwarsii\",\"title\":\"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones\",\"year\":2002,\"rating\":6.7}, {\"id\":\"starwarsi\",\"title\":\"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace\",\"year\":1999,\"rating\":6.5}, {\"id\":\"starwarsvii\",\"title\":\"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens\",\"year\":2015} ] Notice that because Episode VII has no rating (as it was not released yet), it's sorted as the last document. Applying filters In addition to sorting the results, we can also apply filters using the following code: WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .where('year', '', 8.5) .get('movies') .then(function(movies) { console.log(movies); }); WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .where(field: \"year\", op: \"\", value: 8.5) .get(resourcePath: \"movies\") .then { movies in print(movies) } WeDeploy .data('https://data-datademo.wedeploy.io') .where(lt(\"year\", 2000).or(gt(\"rating\", 8.5))) .get(\"movies\") .execute(); The following entries are the result of the above filters: [ {\"id\":\"starwarsiv\",\"title\":\"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\",\"year\":1977,\"rating\":8.7}, {\"id\":\"starwarsv\",\"title\":\"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back\",\"year\":1980,\"rating\":8.8} ] Pagination We can also paginate the result using the 'limit' and 'offset' properties. Combining all the tools we've learned so far, we can run a detailed query on our data: WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .where('year', '', 2000) .orderBy('rating') .limit(2) .offset(1) .get('movies') .then(function(movies) { console.log(movies); }); WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .where(field: \"year\", op: \"","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/data/retrieving-data.md","id":"retrieving-data","url":"/docs/data/retrieving-data.html"},"saving-data":{"title":"Saving Data","description":"Create a new record in the database with any attributes.","headerTitle":"Data","layout":"guide","weight":3,"content":" {$page.title} {$page.description} If you are unfamiliar with our API, please visit the API Clients page first to learn how to install and configure it.

WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .create('movies', [ { \"title\": \"Star Wars III\", \"year\": 2005, \"rating\": 8.0 }, { \"title\": \"Star Wars II\", \"year\": 2002, \"rating\": 8.6 } ]).then(function(movies) { console.log(movies); }); WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .create(resource: \"movies\", object: [ [ \"title\" : \"Star Wars III\", \"year\" : 2005, \"ratings\" : 8.0 ], [ \"title\" : \"Star Wars II\", \"year\" : 2002, \"ratings\" : 8.6 ] ]) .then { movie in print(movie) } JSONObject movie1JsonObject = new JSONObject() .put(\"title\", \"Star Wars III\") .put(\"year\", 2005) .put(\"rating\", 8.0); JSONObject movie2JsonObject = new JSONObject() .put(\"title\", \"Star Wars II\") .put(\"year\", 2002) .put(\"rating\", 8.6); JSONArray moviesJsonArray = new JSONArray() .put(movie1JsonObject) .put(movie2JsonObject); WeDeploy .data('https://data-datademo.wedeploy.io') .create(\"movies\", moviesJsonArray) .execute(); This operation will return the newly created array of documents, with the following generated IDs: [ { \"id\":\" 115992383516607959\", \"title\": \"Star Wars III\", \"year\": 2005, \"rating\": 8.0 }, { \"id\":\" 115992383516607954\", \"title\": \"Star Wars II\", \"year\": 2002, \"rating\": 8.6 } ] Inserting new fields in an existing collection WeDeploy Data service is really flexible in therms of data structure. You're able to insert new fiels in a collection by adding the new key in the object param. WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .create('movies', [ { \"title\": \"Star Wars I\", \"obs\": \"First in ABC order\", \"year\": 1999, \"rating\": 9.0 } ]).then(function(movie) { console.log(movie); }); WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .create(resource: \"movies\", object: [ \"title\": \"Star Wars I\", \"obs\": \"First in ABC order\", \"year\": 1999, \"rating\": 9.0 ]) .then { movie in print(movie) } JSONObject movieJsonObject = new JSONObject() .put(\"title\", \"Star Wars I\") .put(\"obs\", \"First in ABC order\") .put(\"year\", 1999) .put(\"rating\", 9.0); WeDeploy .data('https://data-datademo.wedeploy.io') .create(\"movies\", movieJsonObject) .execute(); This operation will return the newly created document, with the following generated ID: { \"id\":\" 115992383516607954\", \"title\": \"Star Wars I\", \"obs\": \"First in ABC order\", \"year\": 1999, \"rating\": 9.0 } URL scope structure The URL we just created stored a new document in our app's service inside the \"movies\" collection. More information on how to set up this datastore URL can be seen in the section Building APIs. For now, we only need to know that within the path where the data is mounted. The URL will be interpreted as a key that points to a stored resource like the one below: /collectionName/documentId/documentProperty/documentInnerProperty For example, to reference the newly created Star Wars rating, we can use the path: https://-.wedeploy.io/movies/115992383516607958/rating What's next? Now that you've learned how to save, you can start retrieving data. ","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/data/saving-data.md","id":"saving-data","url":"/docs/data/saving-data.html"},"searching-data":{"title":"Searching Data","description":"Advanced queries using search.","headerTitle":"Data","layout":"guide","weight":6,"content":" {$page.title} {$page.description} If you are unfamiliar with our API, please visit the API Clients page first to learn how to install and configure it. Search data We did some great stuff with basic data methods, like create, update, and delete JSON documents. We also learned how to retrieve documents with where, sort, and pagination. What if we need more powerful queries with our documents? In WeDeploy you can do a text search, handle user misspellings, and show the number of documents by category with your data, and much more. First take a look at the text search. It's a simple, yet very powerful way to filter our results by a text query. Using the movie database we created before, let's search for a Star Wars movie by the episode title, like \"Revenge of the Sith\". We are not interested if the letter is in upper or lower case, since we are using English connectors like \"of\" and \"the\". We want something flexible enough that it will also work for texts like \"The revenge of the Sith\", or \"Sith's revenge\". Our match operator is flexible enough for both. WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .match('title', \"Sith's revenge\") .get('movies') .then(function(movies) { console.log(movies); }); WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .match(field: \"title\", pattern: \"Sith's revenge\") .get(resourcePath: \"movies\") .then { movies in print(movies) } WeDeploy .data('https://data-datademo.wedeploy.io') .where(match(\"title\", \"Sith's revenge\")) .get(\"movies\") .execute(); The result of the match operator query is the following entry: [{\"id\":\"starwarsiii\",\"title\":\"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith\",\"year\":2005,\"rating\":7.7}] We can also use simple text operators in our match: // we can run this WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .match('title', '(jedi | force) -return') .get('movies') .then(function(movies) { console.log(movies); }); // or this WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .match('title', 'awake*') .get('movies') .then(function(movies) { console.log(movies); }); // or even this WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .match('title', 'wakens~') .get('movies') .then(function(movies) { console.log(movies); }); // we can run this WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .match(field: \"title\", pattern: \"(jedi | force) -return\") .get(resourcePath: \"movies\") .then { movies in print(movies) } // or this WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .match(field: \"title\", pattern: \"awake*\") .get(resourcePath: \"movies\") .then { movies in print(movies) } // or even this WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .match(field: \"title\", pattern: \"wakens~\") .get(resourcePath: \"movies\") .then { movies in print(movies) } // we can run this WeDeploy .data('https://data-datademo.wedeploy.io') .where(match(\"title\", \"(jedi | force) -return\")) .get(\"movies\") .execute(); // or this WeDeploy .data('https://data-datademo.wedeploy.io') .where(match(\"title\", \"awake*\")) .get(\"movies\") .execute(); // or even this WeDeploy .data('https://data-datademo.wedeploy.io') .where(match(\"title\", \"awake~\")) .get(\"movies\") .execute(); Any search in the previous example results in the following match: [{\"id\":\"starwarsvii\",\"title\":\"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens\",\"year\":2015}] What we did with * can also be done with the prefix operator Filter.prefix('title', 'awake'). The fuzziness we added to 'wakens' using ~, can also be done explicitly with the fuzzy operator Filter.fuzzy('title', 'wakens'). So far we are still just filtering data with filters. We can do so much more than that! If we use 'query search' instead of 'filter' to send those filters to the server, we can also get information about how relevant a document is to a given search, and order our results by this criteria. Let us introduce this with a new filter that allows us to query movies with a title similar to a given text: WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .similar('title', 'The attack an awaken Jedi uses to strike a Sith is pure force!') .search('movies') .then(function(movies) { console.log(movies); }); WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .similar(field: \"title\", query: \"The attack an awaken Jedi uses to strike a Sith is pure force!\") .search(resourcePath: \"movies\") .then { movies in print(movies) } WeDeploy .data('https://data-datademo.wedeploy.io') .where(similar(\"title\", \"The attack an awaken Jedi uses to strike a Sith is pure force!\")) .search(\"movies\") .execute(); We receive not only the documents that match the filter, but also search metadata: { \"total\": 5, \"documents\": [ { \"title\": \"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens\", \"id\": \"starwarsvii\" }, { \"title\": \"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back\", \"id\": \"starwarsv\" }, { \"title\": \"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi\", \"id\": \"starwarsvi\" }, { \"title\": \"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith\", \"id\": \"starwarsiii\" }, { \"title\": \"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones\", \"id\": \"stawwarsii\" } ], \"scores\": { \"starwarsii\": 0.13102644681930542, \"starwarsiii\": 0.13102644681930542, \"starwarsv\": 0.13102644681930542, \"starwarsvi\": 0.13102644681930542, \"starwarsvii\": 0.5241057872772217 }, \"queryTime\": 1 } Notice that the score of the starwarsvii document is bigger than the other matches, indicating its title is more similar to the given filter than the others. The documents in the result are now ordered by the relevance of the document, expressed as a number in the scores metadata, rather than the document's ID. Now we can show not only filtered results, but also order our results by relevance! Want more? Well, let's make things even easier for the user! Adding one entry to the search query, we can automatically highlight the words that matched our query, showing not only how relevant the document is to the search, but also where it matches our criteria. We can do this with small changes in our previous search, using the following code: WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .similar('title', 'The attack an awakened Jedi uses to strike a Sith is pure force!') .highlight('title') .search('movies') .then(function(movies) { console.log(movies); }); WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .similar(field: \"title\", query: \"The attack an awaken Jedi uses to strike a Sith is pure force!\") .highlight(\"title\") .search(resourcePath: \"movies\") .then { movies in print(movies) } WeDeploy .data('https://data-datademo.wedeploy.io') .where(similar(\"title\", \"The attack an awakened Jedi uses to strike a Sith is pure force!\")) .highlight(\"title\") .search(\"movies\") .execute(); As you can see in the code below, our keywords are highlighted in the results: { \"total\": 5, \"documents\": [ { \"title\": \"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens\", \"id\": \"starwarsvii\" }, { \"title\": \"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back\", \"id\": \"starwarsv\" }, { \"title\": \"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi\", \"id\": \"starwarsvi\" }, { \"title\": \"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith\", \"id\": \"starwarsiii\" }, { \"title\": \"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones\", \"id\": \"starwarsii\" } ], \"scores\": { \"starwarsii\": 0.13102644681930542, \"starwarsiii\": 0.13102644681930542, \"starwarsv\": 0.13102644681930542, \"starwarsvi\": 0.13102644681930542, \"starwarsvii\": 0.5241057872772217 }, \"queryTime\": 1 } The third search feature is also quite simple, but can be applied to generate meaningful statistical information about our data. What if we need to compare the average rating the first three movies received, with the last three movies? We can do that with aggregations, using the following code: WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .lt('year', 1990) .aggregate('Old Movies', 'rating', 'avg') .count() .get('movies') .then(function(aggregation) { console.log(aggregation); }); WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .lt(field: \"year\", value: 1990) .aggregate(name: \"Old movies\", field: \"rating\", op: \"avg\") .count() .get(resourcePath: \"movies\") .then { (aggregation: [String : Any]) in print(aggregation) } WeDeploy .data('https://data-datademo.wedeploy.io') .where(lt(\"year\", 1990)) .aggregate(avg(\"Old Movies\", \"rating\")) .count() .get(\"movies\") .execute(); The count we added to the query informed the server that we are not interested in the documents themselves, but rather the number of matches and search metadata. The result, in this case, will be the following data: { \"total\": 3, \"queryTime\": 13, \"aggregations\": { \"Old Movies\": 8.633333333333333 } } Cool, right? Simply run another query for the newest movies, and then you'll have the data you need to compare them. There are some additional operators that you might find useful: min, max, sum, histogram, and even a generic stats that returns several statistics over the field. Take a look at the example below to see results using the additional operators: { \"total\": 3, \"queryTime\": 8, \"aggregations\": { \"Old Movies\": { \"average\": 8.633333333333333, \"count\": 3, \"max\": 8.8, \"min\": 8.4, \"name\": \"Old Movies\", \"standardDeviation\": null, \"sum\": 25.9, \"sumOfSquares\": null, \"variance\": null } } } Notice that in order to read and write your service's root path you need to map it with an API endpoint and data flag active. If we want to inform the server of the data type of a collection field before it receives its first document, we can POST/PATCH the data root with the mapping information: WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .create('movies', { \"location\": \"geo_point\" }); WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .create(body: [ \"places\" : [ \"location\" : \"geo_point\" ] ]) JSONObject locationJsonObject = new JSONObject() .put(\"location\", \"geo_point\"); JSONObject placesJsonObject = new JSONObject() .put(\"places\", locationJsonObject); WeDeploy .data('https://data-datademo.wedeploy.io') .create(\"\", placesJsonObject); We can never update an already mapped field, but we can map new fields in an existing collection, as we did in the request above. When we manually map our collection, we can use some extra datatypes that are not mapped dynamically: date, geopoint, and geoshape. We will focus on geo_point for this next feature. So, we mapped a field called location, in the collection places, as representing a geolocation point. This means we can operate, filter, and aggregate the places we put in that collection, using geo filters over this field! Let's try something simple: find cinemas close to London's Waterloo Station. To run the search criteria, we'll use the following code: WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .any('category', 'cinema') .distance('location', '51.5031653,-0.1123051', '1mi') .get('places') .then(function(places) { console.log(places); }); WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .any(field: \"category\", value: [\"cinema\"]) .distance(field: \"location\", latitude: 51.5031653, longitude: -0.1123051, distance: .mile(1)) .get(resourcePath: \"places\") .then { places in print(places) } WeDeploy .data('https://data-datademo.wedeploy.io') .where(any(\"category\", \"cinema\").and(distance(\"location\", \"51.5031653,-0.1123051\", \"1mi\"))) .get(\"places\") .execute(); Our result is the following matches: [ { \"name\": \"BFI IMAX\", \"location\": \"51.5126928,-0.12052\", \"id\": \"116686224946770924\", \"category\": [ \"cinema\" ] }, { \"name\": \"Cinema Museum\", \"location\": \"51.501661,-0.1177734\", \"id\": \"116686224946770925\", \"category\": [ \"cinema\", \"museum\" ] }, { \"name\": \"Roxy Bar and Screen\", \"location\": \"51.5012603,-0.1146835\", \"id\": \"116686224946770926\", \"category\": [ \"cinema\", \"bar\", \"restaurant\" ] } ] Now we can plug a map to our app, and let users see and filter places, with just a few lines of code.

We built those libraries to make your life easier and adapt to your current workflow. Below you can find a list that contains all of them, including instructions on how to install and details for each specific platform. JavaScript (Web & Node.js) You can use this by adding a script element in your HTML file or to load the library using NPM. Installation CDN NPM npm install --save wedeploy Nuances After installing WeDeploy using NPM, you can load this package like this: var WeDeploy = require('wedeploy'); // Or if you're using ES6 import WeDeploy from 'wedeploy'; This library is compatible with all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and IE10+) as well as React Native and React VR. The API calls are the same in all JavaScript environments. Swift (iOS) In order to start using you have to add it as Cocoapod in your Podfile. Installation Cocoapods pod 'WeDeploy' Nuances By default, all requests returns a promise like below. WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .get(resourcePath: \"movies\") .then { movie - Void in print(movie) } You are also able to return a callback or observable. These two methods are available: // toCallback converts a promise into a callback WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .get(resourcePath: \"movies\") .toCallback { movies, error in // here you can check the error or the response } // toObservable converts a promise into an observable WeDeploy .data('https://-.wedeploy.io') .get(resourcePath: \"movies\") .toObservable() .subscribe( onNext: { movies in // here you receive the movies }, onError: { error in // oops something went wrong } ) Java (Android) You just need to add the following line to your build.gradle file. Installation Gradle compile 'com.wedeploy:com.wedeploy.android:beta-20170505' Nuances Before calling any method from WeDeploy, you have to build an instance first: WeDeploy weDeploy = new WeDeploy.Builder().build(); Then, you are able to synchronously fire requests to WeDeploy by calling execute(): weDeploy .data('https://data-datademo.wedeploy.io') .get(\"movies\") .execute(); You can also fire asynchronous requests by specifying a Callback to the execute() method: weDeploy .data('https://data-datademo.wedeploy.io') .get(\"movies\") .execute(new Callback() { public void onSuccess(Response response) { // here you receive the movies } public void onFailure(Exception e) { // oops something went wrong } }); The WeDeploy Android API is RxJava 2 compatible. This means that you can convert the request into a Single RxJava object, which emits either a success or an error event. You must add a dependency to RxAndroid in your project build.gradle in order to use it. weDeploy .data('https://data-datademo.wedeploy.io') .get(\"movies\") .asSingle() .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io()) .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()) .subscribe( response - { }, throwable - { }); What's next?

","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/intro/api-clients.md","id":"api-clients","url":"/docs/intro/api-clients.html"},"custom-domains":{"title":"Custom Domains","description":"Often times in production apps, you will want to point your service URL's to a custom domain so it's easier for users to find your site and more consistant with your message and branding.","headerTitle":"Intro","layout":"guide","weight":6,"content":" {$page.title} {$page.description} Introduction To make your app live right away, WeDeploy makes every service accessible via its service domain, but when your app moves towards production, you will most likely want to add a custom domain to beautify your websites URL. Configuring custom domains can be a tricky and complicated process, which is why we wanted to make it simple and straightforward for you. Simple Setup The easiest way to configure your custom domain, is to add one of our WeDeploy name servers. Once you point to our name server from your domain provider, you can simply add the custom domain to your service and we will do all the configuration work for you. Go to your domain provider and find where you can set a custom name server. Enter one of the regional WeDeploy name servers from below. Go to the service of your project, click on \"Custom Domains\", and add the new domain. | Country | Name Server | | ----------------- | ------------------------------- | | Australia | sydney.wedeploy.domains | | Germany | frankfurt.wedeploy.domains | | France | paris.wedeploy.domains | | Netherlands | amsterdam.wedeploy.domains | | Singapore | singapore.wedeploy.domains | | United Kingdom | london.wedeploy.domains | | United States | california.wedeploy.domains | | United States | iowa.wedeploy.domains | | United States | newyork.wedeploy.domains | Adding Subdomains Now that you have your root domain setup, you may want to add a subdomain like www.myapp.com. This is very simple and can by done by configuring the CNAME on your domain provider. | Record | Subdomain | Project Target Domain | | ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | | CNAME | www.mydomain.com | ui-myapp.wedeploy.io. | | CNAME | api.mydomain.com | db-myapp.wedeploy.io. | Advanced Configuration What if you want to configure the DNS yourself? No problem, that is a simple process as well. Instead of using a name server to route your project, you can simply add an apex domain as an CNAME. | NAME | TYPE | DATA | | ----------------- | ----------- | ----------------------- | | empty | CNAME | ui-myapp.wedeploy.io. | Attention This method is only available for domain providers that allow CNAME configuration for root domains. What's next? Learn more about using environment variables. ","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/intro/custom-domains.md","id":"custom-domains","url":"/docs/intro/custom-domains.html"},"environment-variables":{"title":"Environment Variables","description":"When building software, we often find ourselves with the need of having different information depending if our code is running locally or in production. Instead of having to hard-code those values, we can take advantage of environment variables.","headerTitle":"Intro","layout":"guide","weight":7,"content":" {$page.title} {$page.description} Introduction Environment variables are a set of dynamic placeholders that can affect the way a certain service will behave. They are dynamic because they can change according to your needs. A good example would be credentials for a database, where each environment has its own values. The ideal solution for handling this scenario, would be using environment variables, in order to set up different configurations for different environments using the same code. WeDeploy can help you configure environment variables in two ways, you can either use the Console or use the wedeploy.json file. Using the Console 1) Go to the specific service page. 2) Click on \"Environment\". 3) Add your keys and values. 4) Click on \"Update Environment\". This will restart your service with the new environment variables. Attention If you create or update a variable on the Console, this will not automatically reflect on wedeploy.json. So make sure you also update your local file if you need both environments in sync. Using wedeploy.json You can also define environment variables directly on your code repository by using the wedeploy.json files like this: { \"id\": \"myservice\", \"env\": { \"DATABASE_USER\": \"root\", \"DATABASE_PASSWORD\": \"test\" } } Attention All environment variables specified on wedeploy.json will be created or updated on the Console. If there are variables specified only on Console, they will remain the same. What's next? Some WeDeploy services have pre-defined environment variables, you can learn more about it by visiting them individually: Auth Environment Variables Email Environment Variables Hosting Environment Variables ","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/intro/environment-variables.md","id":"environment-variables","url":"/docs/intro/environment-variables.html"},"feature-overview":{"title":"Feature Overview","description":"This is an overview of the features that make WeDeploy the easiest way to deploy and scale applications.","headerTitle":"Intro","layout":"guide","weight":2,"content":" {$page.title} {$page.description} Zero downtime upgrades WeDeploy provides automation for updating services and the systems with zero downtime. WeDeploy services can all be updated with rolling, blue-green, or canary deployment patterns. If the update fails, roll it back with a single click. These powerful tools are critical for minimizing downtime and user interruption. Service discovery and load balancing WeDeploy includes several options for automating service discovery and load balancing. Distributed services create distributed problems, but you don’t have to solve them all yourself. WeDeploy includes automatic DNS endpoint generation, an API for service lookup, transport layer (L4) virtual IP proxying for high speed internal communication, and application layer (L7) load balancing for external-facing services. Service visibility WeDeploy provides an option for you to specify whether your service is going to be public or private for public access. High availability WeDeploy is highly available and makes it easy for your services to be highly available too. Mission-critical services require health monitoring, self-healing, and fault tolerance both for themselves and the platform and infrastructure they run on. WeDeploy gives you multiple layers of protection. To achieve self-healing, WeDeploy services are monitored and restarted when they fail. Even legacy services that don’t support distribution or replication can be automatically restarted to maximize uptime and reduce service interruption. Elastic scalability WeDeploy gives you the power to easily scale your services up and down with the turn of a dial. Horizontal scaling is trivial in Docker Swarm, as long as your service supports it. You can change the number of service instances at any time. WeDeploy even lets you autoscale the number of instances based on session count, using the WeDeploy Load Balancer. User interfaces WeDeploy offers two interfaces to make it easy to monitor and manage the projects and its services. The WeDeploy Console lets you monitor resource allocation, running services health, and more with intuitive browser-based navigation, real-time graphs, and interactive debugging tools. The WeDeploy Command-line Interface (CLI) provides you control from the comfort of a terminal. It’s powerful, yet easily scriptable, with handy plugins to interact with installed projects.

If you use macOS, install the Docker for Mac. If you use Windows, please install Docker for Windows. Docker Toolbox, still available for earlier Mac and Windows systems is not supported. Installing If you use a Unix-like system such as macOS or Linux open your Terminal and run: curl https://cdn.wedeploy.com/cli/latest/wedeploy.sh -sL | bash If you use Windows, you probably want the Windows amd64 installer. For other systems, check a list of all builds available. Check your docker configuration: docker comes with a 2.0GB maximum memory limit by default on macOS and Windows. You should increase this limit to at least 4.0GB. Creating projects locally You are able to organize your services by project. Inside each project you can create services (called containers here), like static hosting, data API, Auth service, etc. Use we create to create projects and containers. You can create a project anywhere on your machine. Containers might be created one directory above a project for your convenience. Usage: we create --project --container Running projects locally For this demo we are going to use the hosting boilerplate. Start local infrastructure: we run Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/wedeploy/boilerplate-hosting.git cd boilerplate-hosting Link this container to a new project named demo: we link --project demo Now your container should be accessible from hosting.demo.wedeploy.me The first time you run the project it might take a few minutes while the hosting image is being downloaded in the background. Remotes and friendly host style Many commands requires --project, --container, or --remote flags. You can use the following patterns for passing these values: we --project --container and the friendly host style: we -. or even we - --remote For the local cloud, just don't add a --remote or `` value like in: we log public.chat or to list all logs by containers on the project \"chat\": we log chat Remotes can be managed in a similar fashion as git's remote command: $ we remote -v wedeploy wedeploy.io If you know how to use git remote you already know how to use we remote. For your convenience we include the wedeploy cloud remote by default once you log in on the CLI app with we login (requested when necessary). All commands that support --project, --container, and / or --remote support this host style as well. Fetching project and container logs You can fetch projects and container logs with we log --project --container or with a friendly host style like we log -.wedeploy.me Examples: See the logs for the last 20min for the data container on the wechat project: we log --project wechat --container data --since 20min Watch for logs on the hosting container on the demo project: we log hosting.demo.wedeploy.me --watch Listing projects and containers Watch the listing of all projects running locally: we list --watch List all your projects running on the WeDeploy cloud: we list wedeploy.io or we list --remote wedeploy What's next?

To get started, you first need to create a WeDeploy account by signing up through the Console Signup Page. When you login to the Console, you will see a list of your WeDeploy projects. If you don't have any yet, don't worry, we will go over how to change that below. Create a new project To start, you must create new project by going to the button in the top right corner named \"New Project\". Then you can type an ID for your project. Project names are permanent and cannot be changed later. Once your project is created, it will show up on your Console main page. To see the details of your project, click on the name of the project. Install a service By clicking on a project, you can start monitoring and configuring your project and its services. In each project, you can have up to five services installed. To install a new service, click on the \"Install Service\" button in the top right corner of your project's Console screen. Select a service type You must choose the type of service you want to install. Choose an ID Similar to project ID's, service ID's are permanent and cannot be changed later. When you have chosen an ID, click \"Install Service\". Install service Now WeDeploy will start building and deploying your service automatically. View your service live Once your service is installed, we give you a specific URL for that service that is made up with the service and project ID's (website-strawberry.wedeploy.io). You can always find this URL by clicking on the service in the overview section. What's next? Learn more about using the WeDeploy CLI.

Pro Tip Building an app with multiple services is very easy with WeDeploy. Every directory that contains a wedeploy.json will be treated as a separate service. If a specific image type is not detected, we will scan the conents of the directory and deploy the service that is most like your source code (package.json = Node.js, Dockerfile = Custom Docker Image, index.html = static hosting). yourApp ├── auth │ └── wedeploy.json ├── db │ └── wedeploy.json └── Docker └── wedeploy.json └── Dockerfile ","srcFilePath":"src/pages/tutorials/auth-ios/clone-sample-repo.md","id":"clone-sample-repo","url":"/tutorials/auth-ios/clone-sample-repo.html"},"create-new-project":{"title":"Create New Project","description":"In this section, you'll learn how to authenticate users on an iOS app using the WeDeploy Swift API Client.","buttonTitle":"I created a project","tutorialTitle":"Getting started with WeDeploy Auth on an iOS app","parentId":"auth-ios","layout":"tutorial","time":20,"weight":2,"content":" Create New Project To begin, we will create a new WeDeploy project.

To do this, go to SignUpActivity.java and paste this code in the \"doSignUp\" method: weDeploy.auth(\"auth-.wedeploy.sh\") .createUser(email, password, name) .execute(new Callback() { @Override public void onSuccess(Response response) { showAlert(\"Success\", \"Signed up successfully\"); } @Override public void onFailure(Exception e) { Log.e(\"Error\", \"Sign up error\", e); showAlert(\"Error\", \"Sign up error\"); } }); Note: make sure to replace `` with the id of your project. Sign-in Next, let's add the code that will allow users to sign-in. First of all, go to LoginActivity.java, and paste this code in the \"doLogin\" method: weDeploy.auth(\"auth-.wedeploy.sh\") .signIn(email, password).execute(new Callback() { @Override public void onSuccess(Response response) { showAlert(\"Success\", \"Signed in\"); } @Override public void onFailure(Exception e) { showAlert(\"Error\", \"Login error\"); } }); Note: make sure to replace `` with the id of your project. Pro Tip In the examples above we use the execute(callback) method to handle the response with a callback, which is the most typical way of doing it in the Android ecosystem, but we can also handle the result using a RxJava Single, which is similar to an Observable, but it either emits one value or an error notification: weDeploy.auth(\"auth-.wedeploy.sh\") .signIn(email, password) .asSingle() .subscribe(new DisposableSingleObserver() { @Override public void onSuccess(Response response) { showAlert(\"Success\", \"Signed in\"); } @Override public void onError(Throwable e) { showAlert(\"Error\", \"Login error\"); } }); ","srcFilePath":"src/pages/tutorials/auth-android/add-api-methods.md","id":"add-api-methods","url":"/tutorials/auth-android/add-api-methods.html"},"add-config-files":{"title":"Add Config Files","description":"In this section, you'll learn how to authenticate users on an Android app using the WeDeploy API Client.","buttonTitle":"I added the config files","tutorialTitle":"Getting started with WeDeploy Auth on an Android app","parentId":"auth-android","layout":"tutorial","time":60,"weight":5,"content":" Add Config Files Since every service folder must have a wedeploy.json file that configures the service, let's add one to our Auth Service in the repo we just cloned. Auth Open the tutorial-auth-android folder in a code editor. Create a new file named wedeploy.json inside the auth folder. In that file, paste this code: { \"id\": \"auth\", \"image\": \"wedeploy/auth:beta\", \"env\": { \"WEDEPLOYAUTHSECURE_FIELDS\": \"password\", \"WEDEPLOYAUTHPASSWORD\": \"true\" } } Pro Tip One of the awesome things you can do in your wedeploy.json file is add environment variables. There are many ways to use these; one example is to provide Google sign-in for your users. { \"id\": \"auth\", \"image\": \"wedeploy/auth:beta\", \"env\": { \"WEDEPLOYAUTHSECURE_FIELDS\": \"password\", \"WEDEPLOYAUTHPASSWORD\": \"true\", \"WEDEPLOYAUTHGOOGLE\": \"true\", \"WEDEPLOYAUTHGOOGLECLIENTID\": \"\", \"WEDEPLOYAUTHGOOGLECLIENTSECRET\": \"\" } } See the full list of Environment Variables for Auth.

This folder is not used by the WeDeploy infrastructure, but we have it here to make the example simpler by not using two different repos (one for WeDeploy project and one for the app). Pro Tip Building an app with multiple services is very easy with WeDeploy. Every directory that contains a wedeploy.json will be treated as a separate service. If a specific image type is not detected, we will scan the conents of the directory and deploy the service that is most like your source code (package.json = Node.js, Dockerfile = Custom Docker Image, index.html = static hosting). yourApp ├── auth │ └── wedeploy.json ├── db │ └── wedeploy.json └── Docker └── wedeploy.json └── Dockerfile ","srcFilePath":"src/pages/tutorials/auth-android/clone-sample-repo.md","id":"clone-sample-repo","url":"/tutorials/auth-android/clone-sample-repo.html"},"create-new-project":{"title":"Create New Project","description":"In this section, you'll learn how to authenticate users on an Android app using the WeDeploy API Client.","buttonTitle":"I created a project","tutorialTitle":"Getting started with WeDeploy Auth on an Android app","parentId":"auth-android","layout":"tutorial","time":20,"weight":2,"content":" Create New Project To begin, we will create a new WeDeploy project.
