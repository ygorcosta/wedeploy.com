## Configuring

<aside>

All WeDeploy projects use similar configuration files to prepare your projects for deployment. Learn more on our page about <strong><a href="/docs/deploy/getting-started/">Getting Started with Deploying</a></strong>.

Below is an example of a `wedeploy.json` for a Hosting container.

```application/json
{
  "id": "ui",
  "image": "wedeploy/hosting:@site.version.image.hosting@"
}
```

The `id` for your services are uniquely determined by you.
