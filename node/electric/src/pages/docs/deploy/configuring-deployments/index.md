## wedeploy.json

All WeDeploy services use a `wedeploy.json` file to defines the service's attributes and configurations.

Once you push your local project to WeDeploy, we scan it for `wedeploy.json` files. When we find one, we serve that whole directory as a part of the service you defined within.

For example, let's say you have a project named `app` that uses our Data service with a Node.js application. This is what your project's file structure could look like:

```
app
├── nodejs
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── package.json
│   └── wedeploy.json
└── db
    ├── api.json
    └── wedeploy.json
```

For simple services, all you need to include in your `wedeploy.json` is an `id`, but you can add any of the keys below to your configuration file.

**Using .gitignore**

WeDeploy does not deploy anything that is declared in your `.gitignore` file as long this config file is in the same folder as your `wedeploy.json`.

**Usage:**

Here are all the configuration keys in action within a `wedeploy.json`.

```application/json
{
  "id": "myservice",
  "image": "wedeploy/example",
  "env": {
    "DB_USER": "root",
    "DB_PASSWORD": "pass123",
  },
  "port": 8080,
  "cpu": 2,
  "scale": 2,
  "memory": 2048,
  "volume": "/opt/storage",
  "customDomains": ["myservice.com", "www.myservice.com"],
  "healthChecks": {
    "url": "localhost"
  },
  "dependencies": ["db", "dbadmin"],
  "zeroDowntime": false
}
```

<h4 id="id">id</h4>

When you declare an `id` we will always deploy that service with this ID. If a service with a matching ID exist in your project, it will be overridden by a new deployment.

```application/json
{
  "id": "app"
}
```

<h4 id="image">image</h4>

Every service is a separate Docker container. By declaring an image and version, you are choosing which container you want to deploy for that service.

**WeDeploy Images**

WeDeploy offers a collection of service images you can choose from.

- [WeDeploy Auth](/docs/auth/)
- [WeDeploy Data](/docs/data/)
- [WeDeploy Email](/docs/email/)
- [WeDeploy Hosting](/docs/hosting/)

To deploy one of the official WeDeploy images, you can declare `wedeploy/` and then the image and version you want.

```application/json
{
  "id": "db",
  "image": "wedeploy/data:@site.version.image.data@"
}
```

**Docker Hub Images**

You can also use this image key to call any image from Docker Hub.

```application/json
{
  "id": "db",
  "image": "mysql"
}
```

**Custom Images**

If you want to deploy a custom image that is not published on Docker Hub, you can simply create a `Dockerfile` next to your `wedeploy.json` and not declare any `image` key.

<h4 id="env">env</h4>

Environment variables are a set of dynamic placeholders that can affect the way a certain service will behave. For example, if you are deploying a database and need to pass a password and user.

```application/json
{
  "id": "db",
  "image": "mysql",
  "env": {
    "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD": "pass",
    "MYSQL_ROOT_USER": "example"
  }
}
```

<h4 id="port">port</h4>

**Automatic Detection**

By default, we expose port `80` for all services. If we find a port exposed in your `Dockerfile`, then we will choose the lowest value port. In the example below, we would expose port `3000`.

```
FROM ubuntu
EXPOSE 3000
EXPOSE 4000
```

**Manual Configuration**

To manually set your port, you can use the `port` key in your `wedeploy.json`.

```application/json
{
  "id": "os",
  "port": 4000
}
```

**Blocking Port**

If you want to completely block outside access to a service, you can declare any port that is not exposed.

```application/json
{
  "id": "os",
  "port": 0
}
```
<aside>

Remember that even if you block a service's port, your service can still be securely accessed via hostname by the other services in your project.

</aside>

<h4 id="scale">cpu, memory, and scale</h4>

There are three ways to scale your application.

**CPU** is the number of processors designated to your service.

**Memory** is the amount of RAM designated to your service.

**Scale** is the number of instances designated to your service.

The available resources for these variables are dependent upon the usage limits of your WeDeploy plan. To learn more about upgrading your plan, see our [Pricing Page](https://wedeploy.com/#pricing).

<h4 id="volume">volume</h4>

For many applications, it is necessary to be able to write and access a file system. We make this possible with `volumes`. Each service, allows you to mount an independent volume file system (e.g. `var/lib/app`). Because these file systems are unique to each service, you do not have to worry about your services overwriting changes or files made by other services in your project, even if you declare the same volume path for multiple services.

```application/json
{
  "id": "app",
  "volume": "/opt/app/data"
}
```

<h4 id="customDomains">customDomains</h4>

Each service is deployed with a unique URL (service-project.wedeploy.io), but as your application moves towards production, you will most likely want to add custom domains. This is how you can do that with your `wedeploy.json`.

```application/json
{
  "id": "ui",
  "customDomains": ["myapp.com", "www.myapp.com"]
}
```

If you want to know more about custom domains, check our [Custom Domain Documentation](/docs/intro/custom-domains/).

<h4 id="healthCheck">healthCheck</h4>

Health checks are the way we test the status of your service. We also use them know if a new deployment of your service was successful.

The default health check simply looks to see if the service is running, but certain types of services need a more unique testing system. To do this, you can add a custom health check.

```application/json
{
  "id": "ui",
  "healthCheck": {
    "url": "localhost"
  }
}
```

By putting `localhost` as the health check URL, we will ping the IP of your service, waiting for a `200` response. You could also specify a specific page or path to test like `localhost/blog/`.

For more complex health checks, you can add commands to check the uptime of your service.

```application/json
{
  "id": "db",
  "healthCheck": {
    "command": "curl -X GET --silent --fail 'localhost/blog/'"
  }
}
```

<h4 id="dependencies">dependencies</h4>

For may complex applications, it is important to deploy your services in a specific order. For example, you may want your database to deploy before your frontend UI. You may also want to automatically cancel the deployment of your UI if the database doesn't fully deploy. For this, you can declare service dependencies in your `wedeploy.json`.

```application/json
{
  "id": "ui",
  "dependencies": ["db", "dbadmin"]
}
```

In the example above, the `ui` service will wait to deploy until the `db` and `dbadmin` services have successfully deployed.

<h4 id="zeroDowntime">zeroDowntime</h4>

By default, all services utilize our zero downtime deployment. However, some services, like those using volumes, are not designed for this kind of deployment. In these cases, you can simply turn off the zero downtime deployment of your service.

```application/json
{
  "id": "db",
  "zeroDowntime": false
}
```
