### Node.js

###### {$page.description}

<article id="1">

## Introduction

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is an open-source, cross-platform runtime for developing server-side web applications using JavaScript. It has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O.

## Configuring

<aside>

All WeDeploy projects use similar configuration files to prepare your projects for deployment. Learn more on our page about <strong><a href="/docs/deploy/getting-started/">Getting Started with Deploying</a></strong>.

</aside>

Below is an example of a `wedeploy.json` for a Node.js container. The `id` for your services are uniquely determined by you.

```application/json
{
	"id": "myservice"
}
```

You need to place a `wedeploy.json` wherever you have a `package.json`. If you were deploying a Node.js application, this is what your project could look like:

```xml
myservice
├── index.js
├── package.json
└── wedeploy.json
```

**Ports**

By default, we watch port 80 for Node.js services. If you want to designate a different port to expose (like `3000`), you must do that in the `wedeploy.json`.

```application/json
{
	"id": "myservice",
	"port": 3000
}
```

## Specifying the Node.js version

By default, the Node.js version will be the current stable version. If you want to designate a different version, you can specify it on the [engines property](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#engines) inside `package.json`.

You may add a fixed version:

```application/json
"engines": {
	"node": "8.6.0"
}
```

Or you can specify a range:

```application/json
"engines": {
	"node": ">=8.4 <8.6"
}
```

Now you can start building your Node.js based application.
