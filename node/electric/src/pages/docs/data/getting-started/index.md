### Data

###### {$page.description}

<article id="1">

## Introduction

Our Data service enables you to store data securely to a cloud database, make complex queries instantly, and consume information in real-time.

## Configuring

<aside>

All WeDeploy projects use similar configuration files to prepare your projects for deployment. Learn more on our page about <strong><a href="/docs/deploy/getting-started/">Getting Started with Deploying</a></strong>.

</aside>

Below is an example of a `wedeploy.json` for a Data container.

```application/json
{
	"id": "database",
	"image": "wedeploy/data:@site.version.image.data@"
}
```

The `id` for your services are uniquely determined by you.

## Data Path Construction

For your Data service, we build paths to all your collections and documents. This gives you the option to perform actions on these specific items like DELETE or GET.

This is the anatomy of a WeDeploy data document path.

```text
/collectionName/documentId/documentProperty/documentInnerProperty
```

For example, if we had a collection of movies and wanted to reference the rating of Star Wars Episode IV:

```text
https://<serviceID>-<projectID>.wedeploy.io/movies/episode_iv/rating
```
