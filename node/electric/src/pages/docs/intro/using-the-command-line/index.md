### Using the CLI

###### {$page.description}

<article id="1">

## Install

<aside>

Check for new releases to our CLI on our [Updates page](/updates/cli/).

</aside>

If you use a Unix-like system such as macOS or Linux, open your terminal and run:

```xml
curl https://cdn.wedeploy.com/cli/latest/wedeploy.sh -sL | bash
```

Then try running `we`. You should be able to see the help.

In case of error, try to install it using `sudo`:

```text
curl http://cdn.wedeploy.com/cli/latest/wedeploy.sh -sL | sudo bash
```

If you use Windows, check the [Windows amd64 installer](https://bin.equinox.io/c/8WGbGy94JXa/we-stable-windows-amd64.msi). For other systems, see a list of [all builds available](https://dl.equinox.io/wedeploy/we/stable).

For deploying services you must have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your system ([download](https://git-scm.com/download/)).

## Login to your account

There are two ways you can authenticate, the first option will open up your browser and authenticate you from there:

```xml
we login
```

If you already have an account, it will redirect you to a success page. If you don't have an account yet, you must sign up and confirm your email.

The second option only works if you already have an account and requires you to manually type your email and password:

```xml
we login --no-browser
```

## Logout from your account

In order to switch between different accounts, you can logout from an account by running:

```xml
we logout
```

Note: this will not logout on your browser, only on the terminal.
