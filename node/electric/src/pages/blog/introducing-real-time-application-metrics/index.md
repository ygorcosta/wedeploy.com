**We're glad to announce a brand new metrics API and a real-time metrics view for your applications.**

Through our metrics API, we check the usage of memory, CPU, and bandwidth I/O of your projects every 15 seconds and populate them into easy-to-read graphs right on your WeDeploy Console.

This gives you the power to see how your services are performing and to further develop your applications with useful, accessible data.

#### Why is this a big deal?

We decided to build our own metrics API because we wanted to enable you to easily create extensions and integrations for WeDeploy using this powerful API.

Because of this new feature, we are now able to easily provide things for you that we couldn't before like usage notifications, better informed support answers, or performance enhancements.

#### What's coming next?

This brings us one step closer to something we have been whispering about for a while now, **paid plans**.

I know what you might be thinking, _"Why should I be excited for paid plans?"_ By charging users, it raises the standard for what is expected of our platform as well as enables us to keep providing you with exceptional support and new features!

So what are you waiting for? **[Login to your account](https://console.wedeploy.com)** and checkout the _Metrics_ tab on one of your projects.
