#### What is cURL?

cURL is a command-line tool for making HTTP requests. It's available for most platforms including Linux, Windows and macOS.

You can check if cURL is available by running:

```text/x-sh
curl -I "https://wedeploy.com"
```

Or you can just [download](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) and install it onto your system.

#### What does this change mean?

As you may know, we currently have three official SDKs for [JavaScript](/docs/intro/api-clients/#2), [Swift (iOS)](/docs/intro/api-clients/#3), and [Java (Android)](/docs/intro/api-clients/#4). These libraries are great and will help you work with our services much more easily.

But what happens if you use other languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, or C++? Now you can simply navigate to our documentation and view the code snippets under the cURL tab to see how to make the requests.

#### Where can I see examples?

You can browse our [documentation](/docs) or check some cURL examples below.

**Creating a new user with [WeDeploy Auth](/docs/auth/manage-users/#1):**

```text/x-sh
curl -X "POST" "https://<serviceID>-<projectID>.wedeploy.io/users" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
       "email": "user@domain.com",
       "password": "mysecretpassword"
     }'
```

**Deleting a collection on [WeDeploy Data](/docs/data/deleting-data/#1):**

```text/x-sh
curl -X "DELETE" "https://<serviceID>-<projectID>.wedeploy.io/movies" \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-project-master-token>'
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
```

**Sending an email using [WeDeploy Email](/docs/email/sending-email/#1):**

```text/x-sh
curl -X "POST" "https://<serviceID>-<projectID>.wedeploy.io/emails" \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-project-master-token>' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d $'{
        "from": "me@domain.com",
        "to": "you@domain.com",
        "subject": "Hi there!",
        "message": "What are your plans on Thursday?"
      }'
```

#### And that's it!

This is just one of the many exciting things we've been building for you. We're looking forward to share more improvements in the next few days.
