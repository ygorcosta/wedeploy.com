### Why is this important?

This is a significant milestone for us and for our community too. Now everyone will be able to participate in the development of the SDKs, to apply patches, report and fix issues, or simply give us feedback.

### What is open now?

Besides this very [own website](https://github.com/wedeploy/wedeploy.com) which is already open source and several other projects in our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/wedeploy/), we are now opening to the public the following repositories:

* [WeDeploy SDK for Android](https://github.com/wedeploy/wedeploy-sdk-android)
* [WeDeploy SDK for Swift](https://github.com/wedeploy/wedeploy-sdk-swift)
* [WeDeploy SDK for JavaScript](https://github.com/wedeploy/wedeploy-sdk-js)

Our goal is to involve you even more in the process of building WeDeploy. We are very excited and want you to be part of this journey.

*Happy hacking!*
